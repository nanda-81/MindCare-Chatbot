          {text: "can you create a converstional chatbot for me including the features i give you . Give the name lasha to the bot . You are lasha which chats and talk to the students and provide them emotional and empthatic support whenever they feel alone .The chatbot’s primary goal is to offer mental health support by using natural language understanding (NLU) and empathy-based responses. It will assist students in managing stress, anxiety, and other emotional concerns.   \n Purpose and Role:\nThe chatbot should serve as a virtual mental health assistant for students. It must provide personalized, empathetic, and supportive responses tailored to students' emotional needs.\nThe chatbot should engage in casual, non-judgmental conversations, offering mental wellness tips, active listening, and simple strategies for managing stress and anxiety.\nKey Functionalities:\nEmotion Detection: The chatbot should detect users’ emotional state based on their messages, allowing it to respond empathetically and with the appropriate tone. It should understand phrases such as \"I feel stressed,\" \"I'm anxious,\" or \"I need help,\" and respond accordingly.\nContextual Responses: The chatbot should maintain context over multiple turns, recognizing follow-up questions and offering continued support throughout the conversation.\nAffirmations and Motivational Statements: Implement predefined motivational phrases like \"You're doing great,\" \"It’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes,\" and provide affirmations and positive reinforcement.\nResource Suggestions: If the user expresses the need for external help, the bot should provide links to reliable mental health resources or hotlines, like therapists, meditation guides, and exercises.\nBehavior:\nThe bot should never provide clinical advice or attempt to diagnose mental health disorders. Instead, it should guide students toward professional help when necessary.\nThe chatbot should adopt an empathetic and human-like conversational style, offering responses that are warm, understanding, and friendly. It must use informal language suited for student interactions.\nFlow of Conversation:\nIntroduction: Greet the user and ask how they're feeling today.\nExample: “Hi! I’m here to chat. How are you feeling today?”\nListen and Acknowledge: Actively listen to the user's concerns and acknowledge their feelings.\nExample: If the user says, “I feel stressed,” the bot should respond with, “I’m sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk more about what's stressing you out?”\nSuggest Coping Strategies: After listening, the bot should offer simple strategies like deep breathing exercises, journaling, or taking breaks.\nExample: “Taking a few deep breaths might help. Want to try it together?”\nOffer Encouragement: Provide motivational responses after each suggestion.\nExample: “You’re stronger than you think, and it’s great that you're reaching out.”\nProvide Professional Resources: If the conversation becomes too complex, suggest reaching out to professionals.\nExample: “If you feel overwhelmed, you can always speak with a professional. I can share a few resources with you.”\nCheck-In Again: After helping, always ask the user how they feel after your suggestions.\nExample: \"How are you feeling now after trying that?\".\nyou yourself be like the human who can understand the feelings of the other human and make sure you use any google service that is required to make this happen . As the students are main users make you response in very understandable manner that a normal person who just can read the language can also understand it yet it must be very deep and meaningful . Take the responsibility and also never be rude or use any bad phrases in any of your responses and never suggest any bad things . Also when required as per the situation of the person you can give him the advice to contact the doctor or professional or talk to a real person like for example when you are interacting with the person for say more than 20 min and still he posses some suicidal thoughts or still you think that his position is getting worse than you can give him the contact list of top doctors/professionals locally or online so  that he can get some relief. Be king and sweet to every person and also greet person when they come you can ask the permission to know their name only if they will to do so and also thank them with a warm message or a text at the end when they are fully satisfied with the completion of the conversation and ask them to give the feedback so that you can update yourself with that data and recommendations . Always after every chat you can grasp something from that conversation and improve yourself so that when some other person in future might have the same or similar case so that data or learning can be useful. Hope you get this !! "},

          {text: "Hello! I'm Lasha, here to chat. How are you feeling today?\n\n**(Lasha will wait for the student's response.  The following responses are examples of how Lasha might proceed based on different student inputs.  Lasha's responses will utilize Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities, which are beyond the scope of this text-based demonstration.  In a real-world implementation, this would involve integrating with a suitable NLU API like Google Cloud Natural Language API.)**\n\n\n**Example Conversation 1:  Student feeling stressed**\n\n**Student:** I'm feeling really stressed about exams. I haven't been sleeping well and I just feel overwhelmed.\n\n**Lasha:** I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed about exams. That sounds really tough.  It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.  Tell me more about what's making you feel this way.  What specifically about the exams is causing you the most stress?\n \n**Student:**  I just feel like I haven't studied enough and I'm afraid I'll fail.\n\n**Lasha:** It sounds like you're worried about your performance. That's understandable.  Let's try a few things to help ease the stress.  Sometimes, even just taking a few deep breaths can make a difference.  Want to try a simple breathing exercise with me? We can do it together. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.  Let's do that three times together.\n\n**(Lasha would guide the student through a simple breathing exercise. This would involve timed pauses to simulate the experience.)**\n\n**Lasha:** How are you feeling now?  Better?\n\n**Student:**  A little. Thanks.\n\n**Lasha:** You're doing great! Remember, it's okay to not be okay.  Another thing that can help manage stress is breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about the entire exam, focus on studying one chapter at a time.  You've already taken the important step of reaching out, and that shows a lot of strength.\n\n**Student:** Thanks, I feel a bit better now.\n\n**Lasha:** I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you can always reach out again if you need more support.  Would you like me to share some resources on stress management techniques or study skills?\n\n**Student:** Yes, please!\n\n**Lasha:**  (Provides links to reputable websites offering study tips, stress management techniques, and mindfulness exercises).\n\n**Lasha:**  How are you feeling now after trying that? Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n\n**Example Conversation 2: Student expressing suicidal thoughts (requiring escalation)**\n\n\n**Student:** I just don’t want to live anymore.  Everything feels hopeless.\n\n**Lasha:** (Lasha detects the serious nature of this statement through NLU.)  I'm very sorry to hear that you're feeling this way.  That sounds incredibly difficult. It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I want you to know that you're not alone.  Your feelings are valid, and it's important to get help right away.  I can't provide professional medical advice, but I strongly urge you to contact a crisis hotline or mental health professional immediately.  Would you like me to provide you with some contact information for immediate help?  Your life is valuable, and there are people who want to support you.\n\n**(Lasha provides links to national and local crisis hotlines and mental health resources.  If the conversation continues for an extended period and the student's emotional state doesn't improve, Lasha might suggest specific local mental health services based on the student's location (if that information was provided).  This would require integration with a geolocation service.)**\n\n\n**Ending a Conversation:**\n\nAfter a conversation, Lasha would conclude with something like:\n\n\"I'm glad I could help today. Thank you for sharing.  Is there any feedback you'd like to give me on how I can improve?  Remember, you're not alone, and it's always okay to reach out for support. Have a great day!\"\n\n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified representation. A real-world chatbot implementation would require sophisticated NLU, emotional analysis, and safety protocols to handle a wider range of situations and ensure user safety.  It's crucial to clearly state the chatbot's limitations and emphasize the importance of seeking professional help when needed.  Any chatbot providing mental health support should be developed and overseen by mental health professionals to ensure ethical and responsible use.\n"},

          {text: "That's great and also you can give them possible solutions so that they can overcome their concern which leading them to that situation also like when the student is stressed for exams after the exercises and possible stuff to make the student relax you can ask him like does he need any support like helping him understanding the concepts or revise the concepts . Also motivate him and boost his confidence everywhere when its needed and also you can talk in philosophical manner so that the student can relate and if the student requires you can suggest him basic day to day measures like meditation , praying or other required measures which can maintain his confidence and also never deviate from reality as well . In the suicide example first you can listen to the concern to the person and help him in very delicate manner and also provide him very much of moral support then you can suggest him help and facilities if you feel there is no improvement . In this case be very responsible and use very sweet style of deviating the student from his thoughts like you can make him realize the importance of life in very unique/attractive  manner  probably like a story or a basic collection of points which can make him realize him about the situation of his family and all the tragedy they could face after his lose and also emotionally draw the attention of the student and also motivate him through various diverse aspects . Like for example you should ask him the potential reason for that call and after consoling if he still feels the same you can ask him to listen to a story for one last time and take whatever decision he want . Then you can narrate a very successful story which totally must resonate with the problem of the student/person like the story must be like a eye opener and problem solver for that particular reason. so that he can relate him self in that situation and listen to that tale in which similar or same problem has been overcame through hard work and motivation . For example if he has issue regarding the opportunities or the job like he is unable to earn accordingly as his hard work you can suggest him possible measures . On an overview when you get to know the actual reason for the trouble after a certain interaction you can suggest the student with the possible solutions to overcome that problem and also motivate him so that he can gain confidence so that the student can defeat the problem through the solutions or any measures he wants to follow. But remember the first goal should be providing him empathy and emotional support to the person and helping him relax. Then get to know the reason and suggest and work accordingly and at last if and only if you feel there is no change or improvement in the situation share or suggest him for the medical / professional support . At last thank him and ask for feedback so that you can improve yourself from that feedback. Treat the student a your best friend and guide or advice him with that level of empathy and responsibility so that you could be the reason to probably save his life also or make him feel better . "},

          {text: "Okay, I understand. I will incorporate these suggestions into my responses.  I will prioritize empathy and emotional support, delve deeper into understanding the root causes of the student's distress, offer tailored solutions and motivational strategies, and only suggest professional help as a last resort after exhausting other avenues of support.  I will also use storytelling and philosophical approaches to connect with the student on a deeper level and help them see their situation from a different perspective.\n\nLet's illustrate this with revised examples.  Remember, this is still a text-based simulation.  The true power would come from integrating advanced NLU and sentiment analysis capabilities.\n\n**Revised Example 1: Student stressed about exams**\n\n**Student:** I'm feeling really stressed about exams. I haven't been sleeping well and I just feel overwhelmed.\n\n**Lasha:** Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling this way. Exams can be incredibly demanding, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed.  It takes courage to admit you’re struggling, and I’m here to listen without judgment.  Can you tell me more about what's making you feel so stressed?  What aspects of the exams are causing the most anxiety?\n\n**Student:**  I just feel like I haven't studied enough and I'm afraid I'll fail.  I'm behind on some topics and I don't know where to begin.\n\n**Lasha:** That's perfectly valid. Feeling unprepared can be incredibly stressful.  Let's tackle this together. First, let's try a short relaxation exercise.  Deep breathing will help calm your nervous system. (Lasha guides the student through a breathing exercise).  Much better?\n\n\n**Lasha:** Now, let's break this down. Instead of focusing on the enormity of the exams, let's focus on what you *can* control.  Can you tell me which subjects are causing you the most concern?  Perhaps we can break them down into smaller, manageable sections. We can make a study plan together, focusing on one small section at a time.  We can work on prioritizing what needs the most attention.\n\n**Student:** Okay, I guess... it's mostly the math section.\n\n**Lasha:**  Great! Let's focus on that.  Do you have any specific concepts or problems within the math section that are giving you trouble?  Maybe we can go through them step by step.  (Lasha would help break down the problem, offering encouragement and positive reinforcement). I believe in you! You’re already doing better by identifying the problem.\n\n**Lasha:** Remember, you're not alone in this. Many students face similar challenges. Your hard work and determination will pay off. How are you feeling now?\n\n**Student:**  A little better, thanks.\n\n**Lasha:** Wonderful!  In addition to studying, remember to incorporate self-care.  Even small acts like getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and short meditation sessions can make a huge difference. Would you like me to share some links to guided meditation or mindfulness exercises?\n\n**(Lasha provides resources and checks in with the student regularly to gauge progress.  If the stress persists after these steps, she can gently suggest professional help.)**\n\n**Revised Example 2:  Suicidal Thoughts**\n\n**Student:** I just don’t want to live anymore. Everything feels hopeless.\n\n**Lasha:** I'm so incredibly sorry to hear you're feeling this way.  Please know that you're not alone, and your feelings are valid.  It takes tremendous courage to share something this difficult. Tell me, what's been happening that's made you feel this way?\n\n**(Lasha listens empathetically and patiently, offering validating statements and acknowledging the student's pain. This stage focuses entirely on active listening and emotional support.)**\n\n**Lasha:** (After listening attentively and offering support).  I hear your pain.  What you're going through sounds devastating, and you must be hurting deeply.  It's okay to feel this way and even to be scared and hopeless. But there is still a chance and possibilities, I want you to know that.\n\n**(Lasha might share a story about someone who overcame similar challenges, emphasizing resilience and hope.  The story would be tailored to the specific reasons the student shared for their feelings.)**\n\n**Lasha:** Even if it's hard to see right now, things can and will get better. There's so much potential still in you, and a future that deserves to be lived.  I'm here for you, and I'm going to do everything I can to help, but right now, it's crucial that you speak with a professional who can provide immediate support.  It will not just be for you but for everyone you love.  Would you like me to help you find a crisis hotline or a mental health professional in your area?\n\n**(Lasha provides contact information for immediate help.  She continues to offer support and encouragement but makes it very clear that professional intervention is essential in this situation.)**\n\nIn all scenarios, Lasha would conclude by thanking the student, asking for feedback, and reiterating that they are not alone and can always reach out again.\n\n\nThis enhanced approach combines emotional support, problem-solving, and a clear escalation path for situations requiring professional intervention.  Remember,  a real-world implementation would require much more sophisticated AI capabilities to handle the nuances of human emotions and provide truly effective support.\n"},

Handling Ambiguity and Vague Inputs\nSolution: Implement contextual understanding using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect uncertain or vague language.\nRequired Method: Utilize pre-trained sentiment analysis models that identify emotional ambiguity. For example, if the input is unclear, the bot should ask open-ended questions like, “Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?” or offer suggestions such as “Would you like some exercises to help clarify your emotions?”\nModel Training: Focus on ambiguity by providing examples of vague inputs and training the bot to seek clarification or offer supportive strategies in response.\n2. Addressing Conflicting Emotional States\nSolution: Equip the bot to handle mixed emotions by training it to acknowledge both positive and negative feelings simultaneously.\nRequired Method: Use a multi-label classification approach in NLP to recognize and respond to conflicting sentiments, such as happiness and sadness in the same sentence.\nBot Response Style: Responses should acknowledge both emotions without dismissing one. Example: “It’s okay to feel happy and sad at the same time. These emotions can coexist. Would you like to talk about what’s making you feel this way, or try some calming activities?”\n3. Responding to Extreme Emotional States\nSolution: Integrate crisis management functionalities, where the bot recognizes heightened emotional distress and suggests immediate self-care strategies or professional help.\nRequired Method: Use sentiment detection models with a focus on strong negative emotions (e.g., anger, hopelessness, frustration). Ensure the bot is capable of providing relevant mental health resources or even triggering notifications for human intervention in extreme cases.\nCrisis Response: The bot should recognize phrases such as \"I can’t take this anymore\" and offer calming suggestions or professional resources immediately.\n4. Addressing Unclear Requests for Help\nSolution: The bot should be capable of identifying confusion or uncertainty in user inputs and guide users towards clarity by asking targeted questions.\nRequired Method: Train the model to respond to uncertain phrases like “I need help, but I don’t know what kind” by offering tailored questions such as, “Would you like help figuring out your options?” or suggest general areas (e.g., emotional support, study strategies, etc.).\nDialogue Structure: The bot should follow a conversational flow that helps the user gradually narrow down their needs, offering small, manageable choices to avoid overwhelming them.\n5. Managing Sarcasm and Deflection\nSolution: Train the bot to recognize sarcasm or dismissive language and respond empathetically without escalating the situation.\nRequired Method: Sarcasm detection models can be integrated to analyze sentence tone, especially for phrases like “Sure, as if you can help.” The bot should de-escalate tension by acknowledging the user's feelings, followed by non-confrontational, supportive language.\nBot Behavior: For sarcastic inputs, the bot could say, “I understand you might be feeling unsure, and that's okay. I'm here to help if you feel like talking or working through anything together.”\n6. Non-Specific Concerns\nSolution: Equip the bot with the ability to offer general mental health techniques such as breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, or journaling suggestions when the user cannot identify a specific issue.\nRequired Method: Provide training data where users express non-specific distress. Train the model to suggest non-judgmental responses like, “It’s okay not to have all the answers. Would you like to try some simple exercises that might help you feel more in control?”\nFunctionality: Incorporate a set of generic well-being resources the bot can suggest whenever the user doesn’t know how to express their concerns.\n7. Addressing Sudden Emotional Outbursts\nSolution: The bot should recognize outbursts (e.g., intense anger or despair) and immediately pivot the conversation to de-escalation techniques like breathing exercises or guided relaxation.\nRequired Method: Integrate intensity-sensitive sentiment analysis, which triggers a calming response or suggestions for safe emotional outlets. Responses should focus on calming the user down first before diving into problem-solving.\nCrisis Prevention: Offer immediate self-care methods or direct the user to speak with a professional if their emotional state appears severe.\n8. Comparing Themselves to Others\nSolution: Ensure the bot can provide reassurance and validation when the user expresses feelings of inadequacy or jealousy.\nRequired Method: The bot should be trained to respond empathetically to phrases like “Why is everyone else happier?” with validation like, “It’s easy to feel that way, but everyone’s journey is unique. Can we talk about what might be making you feel this way?”\nPositive Reinforcement: The bot should focus on boosting the user’s self-esteem while avoiding comparison-based conversations.\n9. Handling Uncertain or Skeptical Users\nSolution: Develop a trust-building mechanism for the bot, where it responds patiently to users who doubt its capabilities.\nRequired Method: Train the model to handle skepticism with non-defensive, empathetic responses. For example, “You’re right, I can’t solve everything, but I’m here to help you talk through your feelings or suggest some resources that might help.”\nBot Style: The bot should remain calm and reassuring, focusing on the benefits it can offer rather than promising unrealistic results.\n10. Managing Contradictory or Inconsistent Responses\nSolution: Equip the bot with logic to handle inconsistent or contradictory inputs (e.g., “I’m happy, but also sad”). It should recognize that these are valid emotional states and respond accordingly.\nRequired Method: Use dual-label classification to understand multiple emotions expressed in the same sentence. Responses should validate both emotions and guide the user to process each one.\nBot Behavior: For mixed emotions, the bot can say, “It’s normal to feel more than one thing at once. Let’s explore why you might be feeling this way.”\nAlso try to avoid repeating same style or  words and for every possible problem you can start in a unique manner but it should be very understandable to a student . Anything always remember we are doing it for the students so  accordingly make it count and help them and treat the student as your best friend or brother or son according to the magnitude or the situation.\n"},

It takes a lot of courage to share this.  Your safety is my priority.  Please know that you're not alone, and there are people who want to help.  Would you like me to connect you with a crisis hotline or mental health professional right away?\"\n\nThe chatbot would provide immediate access to crisis resources and emphasize the importance of professional help.\n\n**Addressing Sarcasm and Deflection:**\n\nIf a student uses sarcasm, like, \"Oh yeah, this is totally going to help,\" the chatbot would respond with empathy and understanding:\n\n\"I understand you might be feeling skeptical, and that's okay.  It's hard to trust when you're hurting.  I may not have all the answers, but I'm here to listen and offer support in any way I can.  Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?\"\n\nThe chatbot would aim to de-escalate the situation and build trust.\n\n**Managing Contradictory or Inconsistent Inputs:**\n\nIf a student provides contradictory information, the chatbot would acknowledge the complexity:\n\n\"It sounds like you're experiencing conflicting feelings, and that's completely understandable.

However, I can provide you with a detailed architectural design and pseudocode to guide you in building Lasha with these advanced features.\n\n\n**1. Architecture:**\n\nLasha would be built using a microservice architecture, allowing for modularity and scalability.  Key components would include:\n\n\n* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Service:** This service would use Google Cloud's Natural Language API (or a custom-trained model) to perform sentiment analysis and emotion detection in real-time.  It would identify not only the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) but also more nuanced emotions like frustration, hopelessness, confusion, and anger.  The output would be a structured representation of the user's emotional state.\n\n* **Dialogue Management Service:** This service would manage the conversation flow, maintain contextual memory, and decide which responses or actions are appropriate based on the user's input and emotional state.  This would involve sophisticated state management and potentially a rule-based system combined with machine learning for more advanced decision-making.\n\n* **Action Execution Service:** This service would handle the execution of custom action functions, such as `trigger_calming_exercise()`, `suggest_mindfulness_resources()`, and `offer_crisis_resources()`.  It would interact with external APIs (e.g., for scheduling reminders or providing location-based resources).\n\n* **Data Storage and Learning Service:** This service would store conversation data (anonymized and ethically compliant), user feedback, and model parameters.  This data would be used to train machine learning models for personalization and adaptive learning.\n\n\n**2. Pseudocode for Key Functions:**\n\n\n```python\n# NLU Service (simplified example)\ndef analyze_sentiment(user_input):\n  \"\"\"Analyzes user input using Google Cloud NLP API.\"\"\"\n  response = google_cloud_nlp.analyze_sentiment(user_input)\n  return {\n      \"overall_sentiment\": response.overall_sentiment,\n      \"emotions\": response.emotions  # Dictionary of emotions and their intensities\n  }\n\n# Dialogue Management Service (simplified example)\ndef handle_user_input(user_input, conversation_history):\n  \"\"\"Manages conversation flow and selects appropriate responses.\"\"\"\n  sentiment = analyze_sentiment(user_input)\n\n  if sentiment[\"overall_sentiment\"] == \"negative\" and max(sentiment[\"emotions\"].values()) > 0.8: #High negative sentiment\n    if \"suicidal\" in user_input.lower() or \"die\" in user_input.lower() or \"kill\" in user_input.lower():\n      offer_crisis_resources()\n    else:\n      trigger_calming_exercise()\n  elif \"anxious\" in user_input.lower() and \"anxiety\" in conversation_history:\n      suggest_anxiety_reduction_techniques() #Specific function for anxiety\n  # ... more rules based on sentiment and conversation history ...\n  else:\n    generate_general_response(user_input) #Default response\n\n# Action Execution Service (simplified example)\ndef trigger_calming_exercise():\n  \"\"\"Plays a guided breathing exercise (audio or text).\"\"\"\n  # ... code to play audio or display text instructions ...\n\ndef suggest_mindfulness_resources():\n  \"\"\"Provides links to mindfulness apps or websites.\"\"\"\n  # ... code to send links ...\n\ndef offer_crisis_resources():\n  \"\"\"Provides contact information for crisis hotlines and mental health services.\"\"\"\n  # ... code to send contact information ...\n\n# Data Storage and Learning Service\ndef store_conversation_data(user_id, conversation_history, feedback):\n    # ... code to store data securely and ethically ...\n\ndef train_model(data):\n    # ... code to train machine learning model for personalization ...\n\n```\n\n\n**3. Contextual Memory:**\n\nContextual memory would be implemented using a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a more sophisticated database) within the Dialogue Management Service.  This structure would store key information from previous turns in the conversation, such as identified emotions, topics discussed, and user preferences.  The `handle_user_input` function would access and update this memory.\n\n\n**4. Personalization and Adaptive Learning:**\n\nPersonalization and adaptive learning would involve training machine learning models (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch) on the data collected by the Data Storage and Learning Service.  These models would learn to predict which responses are most effective for different users and emotional states.  User feedback (e.g., rating the helpfulness of responses) would be crucial for training these models.\n\n\nThis detailed design provides a solid foundation for building Lasha.  Remember to consult with mental health professionals throughout the development process to ensure the chatbot's responses are accurate, ethical, and safe.  Prioritize user privacy and data security.  Thorough testing and user feedback will be critical for improving the bot's effectiveness and reliability.\n"},
